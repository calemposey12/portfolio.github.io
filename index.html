		<h3> About Me </h3>
		<p><b>Hello Everyone,</b><br>
		Welcome and thank you for visiting my page. <br>
		This is to display the work that I have created in my 
		time in order to become a developer. <br>
		The path may take some time, but the end goal is never impossible.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
		I attended Georgia Southern University with a Bachelors of Science degree.
		Although I majored in Sport Management, I double minored in Business and 
		Information Systems. These two minors correlated with my major due to its
		focused solely being business based opposed to ethical or policy focused 
		compared to other universities. While taking classes for Information 
		Systems, I first became exposed to minor programming with languages 
		such as: SQL and Java. In order for me to gain a better understanding about
		languages, I took the initiative to teach myself Java along with the likes
		of HTML and CSS in my spare time within the past year. </p>
		<p>
		What drives me to become a developer is that it teaches you to use your
		problem-solving, analytical, and creativing skills. Not only are these
		traits are important, but also the willingness to learn. </p>
		<p>
		Being an individual that is willing to constantly learn, self-motivated, 
		and likes solving problems is what makes me different. By not only having
		techinical skills, but soft skills with is what I bring to the table. 
		Having interaction with others is a key aspect and with a history of 
		customer service with pervious jobs, it plays a vital part with any 
		industry. 
		</p>
